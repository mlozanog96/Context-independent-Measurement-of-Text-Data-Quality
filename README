### Context-independent measurement of text  data quality

## Abstract
This project focuses on developing and applying the Context-Independent Measurement of Textual Data Quality. Context-independent refers to text features unrelated to the text's interpretation or meaning, such as grammar. The Context-Independent Measurement of Textual Data Quality is performed by using ten defined and standardized metrics, which can be summed in three dimensions (Accuracy, Completeness, and Consistency) due to the alignment of requirements to create data quality metrics. The thesis includes a case study in which the proposed measurement is implemented, and the resulting data are analyzed to discern the effects of improved Data Quality compared to the performance of a Sentiment Analysis model.

## Content
